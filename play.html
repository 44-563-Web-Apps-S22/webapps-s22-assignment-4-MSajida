        <h2> The Miser</h2>
        <h3 class="direction"> Act III : The Act is between Valere and  Master Jacques </h3>
        <p>
           <h5 class="VAL"> VAL.</h5> <p class="speech">(_laughing_). Well, Master Jacques, your frankness is badly
            rewarded, I fear.</p><br>

<h5 class="JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="speech">S'death! Mr. Upstart, you who assume the man of consequence, it
is no business of yours as far as I can see. Laugh at your own
cudgelling when you get it, and don't come here and laugh at mine. </p>

<h5 class="VAL">VAL.</h5> <p class="speech">Ah! Master Jacques, don't get into a passion, I beg of you.</p>

<h5 class="JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="speech">(_aside_). He is drawing in his horns. I will put on a bold face,
and if he is fool enough to be afraid of me, I will pay him back
somewhat. (_To_ VALÈRE) Do you know, Mr. Grinner, that I am not
exactly in a laughing humour, and that if you provoke me too much, I
shall make you laugh after another fashion. (JACQUES _pushes_ VALÈRE
_to the farther end of the stage, threatening him_.) </p>

<h5 class="VAL">VAL.</h5> <p class="speech">Gently, gently.</p>

<h5 class="JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="speech">How gently? And if it does not please me to go gently?</p>

<h5 class="VAL">VAL.</h5> <p class="speech">Come, come! What are you about?</p>

<h5 class="JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="speech">You are an impudent rascal.</p>

<h5 class="VAL">VAL.</h5> <p class="speech">Master Jacques....</p>

<h5 class="JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="speech">None of your Master Jacques here! If I take up a stick, I shall
soon make you feel it.</p>

<h5 class="VAL">VAL.</h5> <p class="speech">What do you mean by a stick? (_Drives back_ JACQUES _in his
turn_.)</p>

<h5 class="JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="speech">No; I don't say anything about that.</p>

<h5 class="VAL">VAL.</h5> <p class="speech">Do you know, Mr. Conceit, that I am a man to give you a drubbing
in good earnest? </p>

<h5 class="JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="speech">I have no doubt of it.</p>

<h5 class="VAL">VAL.</h5> <p class="speech">That, after all, you are nothing but a scrub of a cook?</p>
