        <h3> The Miser</h3>
        <h5> Act III : The Act is between Valere and  Master Jacques </h5>
        <p>
            VAL. (_laughing_). Well, Master Jacques, your frankness is badly
            rewarded, I fear.<br>

JAC. S'death! Mr. Upstart, you who assume the man of consequence, it
is no business of yours as far as I can see. Laugh at your own
cudgelling when you get it, and don't come here and laugh at mine.<br>

VAL. Ah! Master Jacques, don't get into a passion, I beg of you.<br>

JAC. (_aside_). He is drawing in his horns. I will put on a bold face,
and if he is fool enough to be afraid of me, I will pay him back
somewhat. (_To_ VALÈRE) Do you know, Mr. Grinner, that I am not
exactly in a laughing humour, and that if you provoke me too much, I
shall make you laugh after another fashion. (JACQUES _pushes_ VALÈRE
_to the farther end of the stage, threatening him_.) <br>

VAL. Gently, gently.<br>

JAC. How gently? And if it does not please me to go gently?<br>

VAL. Come, come! What are you about?<br>

JAC. You are an impudent rascal.<br>

VAL. Master Jacques....<br>

JAC. None of your Master Jacques here! If I take up a stick, I shall
soon make you feel it.<br>

VAL. What do you mean by a stick? (_Drives back_ JACQUES _in his
turn_.)<br>

JAC. No; I don't say anything about that.<br>

VAL. Do you know, Mr. Conceit, that I am a man to give you a drubbing
in good earnest? <br>

JAC. I have no doubt of it. <br>

VAL. That, after all, you are nothing but a scrub of a cook?
