            <h5 class="JAC">JAC.</h5> <p sclass="speech">I beg your pardon.</p>

            <h5 class="VAL">VAL.</h5> <p class="speech">I don't like your jesting, and (_beating_ JACQUES) remember that
            you are but a sorry hand at it.</p>
            
            <h5 class="JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="speech">(_alone_). Plague take all sincerity; it is a bad trade. I give
            it up for the future, and will cease to tell the truth. It is all very
            well for my master to beat me; but as for that Mr. Steward, what right
            has he to do it? I will be revenged on him if I can.</p>
